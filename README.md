My project is made by the XIAO rp2040, 3 leds ,and 3 buttons. I made a memory game by which one of the two leds ligth you must press on the button mathcing with it if you press the right buttone you will win the game if you press the wrong button you will lose.

This game works as follows:
- one of the LEDs lights up.
- You must press the button corresponding to the lit LED.
- If you press the correct button, you win the game.
- If you press the wrong button, you lose the game.
